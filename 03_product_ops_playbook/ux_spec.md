## 3. Constraints
*   **Technical Stack:** Must integrate with existing backend services (API-driven) and leverage current AI/ML models for recommendations.
*   **Security & Privacy:** Adhere to strict data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for user data handling.
*   **Performance:** Page load times for booking steps must not exceed 2 seconds.
