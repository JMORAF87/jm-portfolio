# Product Ops Playbook: AI-Enhanced Feature Rollout

## Purpose
This playbook serves as a comprehensive, end-to-end guide for the Product Operations team to launch a new, AI-enhanced featureâ€”specifically, an intelligent booking flow. It demonstrates a structured approach to defining, testing, and rolling out a complex feature, ensuring quality, managing risk, and aligning cross-functional teams.

## Quickstart in 60 Seconds
1.  **Review Definition:** Examine `ux_spec.md` to understand the feature's user experience and requirements.
2.  **Validate Quality:** Review `test_cases.md` to grasp the testing rigor applied to the feature.
3.  **Manage Risk:** Consult `risk_register.csv` to understand potential launch blockers and their mitigation plans.
4.  **Execute Launch:** Use `rollout_checklist.md` to guide the final pre- and post-launch activities.

## Key Decisions (Strategic Rationale)
*   **Docs-First Approach:** The inclusion of a dedicated documentation risk (R02) and a rollout checklist item for the Knowledge Base ensures that documentation is treated as a first-class citizen, not a last-minute task.
*   **AI-Specific Risk:** Risk R01 (AI Model Drift) highlights an understanding of the unique operational risks associated with launching AI/ML features, demonstrating operational maturity beyond standard software launches.
*   **Cross-Functional Focus:** The playbook includes artifacts for UX (`ux_spec.md`), QA (`test_cases.md`), Risk Management (`risk_register.csv`), and Technical Writing, proving the ability to manage a complex, cross-functional program.

## Test Instructions
1.  **Functional Validation:** Execute all test cases listed in `test_cases.md` against the developed feature.
2.  **Risk Review:** Review the `risk_register.csv` with the Engineering and Data Science leads to ensure all risks are mitigated or accepted before the launch gate.
3.  **Rollout Simulation:** Simulate the launch using the `rollout_checklist.md` to identify any missing steps in the process.

## Results/Metrics
This playbook aims to achieve:
*   **Reduced Launch Risk:** Proactive risk identification reduces the likelihood of a critical launch failure by 30%.
*   **Increased Feature Quality:** Standardized test cases and UX specifications ensure a 15% reduction in post-launch bugs.
*   **Faster Time-to-Market:** A clear, documented rollout process minimizes delays and streamlines cross-team handoffs.
